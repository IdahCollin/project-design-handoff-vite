# Design Handoff Project

Week 11 of Technigo Boot camp. Collab with UX design student. A Landing page and About page with React. Browser router, reusable components and Internationalisation library (react-i18next) for translation.

Reusable components in this project:
Logo, footer, infofooter, navbar.


### The Problem

The key learning-goal for this week was to collaborate with a ux-designer and to code their design. Since we are both students not knowing that much about each other's field there were some challenges to implement photos of low quality etc. and interpretting the design. 1/3 prototypes was working (mobile) which made it a bit hard to interpret the design and sizes. With good communication mid-week we decided not to code the whole Abput page. A link to the designer's Figma was added to the About page. In that way the designer can show the link but also direct the viewer to her original work.

A form was prepped but as there was no form in the design I decided to comment it out.

Team-mates, course material, chatGPT were used. chatGPT was used for the translation as it could save time copying the endpoints and code I've written in the en.json file. Although the translation itself would had to be change in a real world scenario.

Fellow team-mate Inna Kokic was developing the same design. Even though we worked individually it made us able to discuss some issues interpretting the design etc.
