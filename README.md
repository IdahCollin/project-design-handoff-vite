# Design Handoff Project

Week 11 of Technigo Boot camp. Collab with UX design student. A Landing page and About page with React. Browser router, reusable components and Internationalisation library (react-i18next) for translation.

Reusable components in this project:
Logo, footer, infofooter, navbar, burgermenu


### The Problem

The key learning-goal for this week was to collaborate with a ux-designer and to implement their design. Since we are both students not knowing that much about each other's field there were some challenges to implement photos of low quality, waiting for info and interpretting the design. 1/3 prototypes was working (mobile) which made it a bit hard to interpret the design and sizes. With good communication mid-week we decided not to code in detail and to shorten the About page (I had to change designer which gave me less time coding as I had prepared structure and code for the first design). A link to the designer's Figma was added to the About page with a hover effect (click the "GALACTIC FITNESS 2023 BY RODOPI DESIGNS" in the footer). In that way the designer can show the link but also direct the viewer to her original work. 

A burger menu is prepped with styling etc.. Decision was made to instead click the burger icon to go to the About page, and click the logo to go to the Landing page. And instead of hamburger try to input music from Star-wars. After a while I ended up getting a link with code from Spotify due to property rights.  Buttons were added for translation. 

A form was prepped but as there was no form in the design I decided to comment it out. As one of the learning goals was to try out animations they are left in this project in learning purposes. I have attentionally left files from animation in learning purposes as well as that was one of our learning goals.

Team-mates, course material, chatGPT were used. chatGPT was used for the translation as it could save time copying the endpoints and code I've written in the en.json file. Although the translation itself would had to be change in a real world scenario.
